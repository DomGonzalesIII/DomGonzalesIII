## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Dom and I'm an aspiring Data Engineer. I've worked in IT for 6 years and got that itch again to change course and pursue a new venture.

## Current Efforts â˜•
I'm taking the IBM Data Engineering Certificate course on Coursera. Along the way, I'm building out my portfolio with projects and working to expand my knowledge.
